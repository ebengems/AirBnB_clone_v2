<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

The first draft of a student effort to create an exact replica of the AirBnB website may be seen in this repository. In this phase, a backend console interface for managing program data is implemented. The user can control file storage, create, update, and destroy objects using console commands. Storage is durable across sessions thanks to a system of JSON serialization and deserialization.
